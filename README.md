# CS172 Final Project:

This final project was a accumulation of the knowledge learned through the second introductory course of the Whitworth CS Program.

# How to run the program:
1. Build the project to create the main.exe folder (this code was created and run in the latest version of Visual Studio Code)
2. Run the project (i.e. terminal -> run task -> run)
3. Following this a screen will pop up in the terminal prompting you with some options. Select all the options that you want to do.
4. When you decide that you want to be done to the program, return to the main menu (the first screen after you login) and select the "Logout from System" option
5. After this the program will close, saving any changes made during the users time in the system (whether that be checking out books, making a new user account, etc.) with the .txt files in the repo

# Things that could be used to improve the design given the knowledge I have now (almost 1/2 year later)
1. I don't know how I would go about this, but I would think about adding some encryption to the system. The system works as I've intended it to. However, the fact that personal information is held within easy to access .txt files would make any system extremely vulnerable to hacks. As such, I would research into ways to encrypt the data used in the system to prevent people's information being at risk.
2. I would like to build a more user friendly design on the visual end. I tried my best to use the terminal as a way of getting the system to appear to the user. However, It seems fairly clunky and relies only on text response from the user to work. I would like to make a display that allows the user to work to feel more at ease in being able to use my system.
3. I would like to add more options to my system. My current system allows for the user to search directly for books and to search through the catalog themselves. However, options you would normally see in a library system (such as being able to search by keyword or author) are unavailable. I would like to add these type of things in the future if I ever came back to this project.
4. I could add more types of things to the catalog. Sometimes, libraries will have things like Movies, DVDs or other types of media available for people to check out. It would be nice if I could make my system more open to that rather than having it only be able to deal with books.
