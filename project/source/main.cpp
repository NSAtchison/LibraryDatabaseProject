//This function will bring up a login screen in console that will give three options: Continue as Guest, Login or Register
//Input: Database& libData: The library database, brought in so that it can be updated and accessed as necessary
//Output/return: If the user continues as a guest, Guest object is created but nothing changed
//               If user logs in, either a Admin object is created or RegisteredUser object is created
//               If user registers, a new RegisteredUser object is created and then added to the database

//Input: N/A
//Output/Return: Main login screen printed to console

//Function that runs the entire login process
//Input: Database& libData: The library database, used for searching through users in the database as well as changing the database if necessary
//Output/Return: Several lines of text will print to console depending on input of user
